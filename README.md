# GBrain

Your AI agent is smart but it doesn't know anything about your life. GBrain fixes that. Meetings, emails, tweets, calendar events, voice calls, original ideas... all of it flows into a searchable knowledge base that your agent reads before every response and writes to after every conversation. The agent gets smarter every day.

> **~30 minutes to a fully working brain.** Your agent does the work. Database ready in 2 seconds (PGLite, no server). Schema, import, embeddings, and integrations take 15-30 minutes depending on brain size. You just answer questions about API keys.
>
> **Requires a frontier model.** Tested with **Claude Opus 4.6** and **GPT-5.4 Thinking**. Likely to break with smaller models.

## Need an AI agent first?

GBrain is designed to be installed and operated by an AI agent. If you don't have one running yet:

- **[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai)** — Deploy [AlphaClaw on Render](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/chrysb/alphaclaw) (one click, requires 8GB+ RAM instance)
- **[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)** — Deploy on [Railway using this template](https://github.com/praveen-ks-2001/hermes-agent-template) (one click)

<details>
<summary><strong>OpenClaw local install failing?</strong> (Homebrew / sudo errors)</summary>

The `curl ... | bash` pipe eats stdin, so Homebrew's installer can't prompt for
your sudo password — even if you are an admin. If you see:

```
✗ Installing Homebrew failed
Warning: Running in non-interactive mode because `stdin` is not a TTY.
Need sudo access on macOS (e.g. the user … needs to be an Administrator)!
```

**Fix 1 — Install Homebrew first, then re-run OpenClaw:**

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# once Homebrew is installed, re-run:
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Fix 2 — Install with npm or bun directly (no Homebrew needed):**

```bash
npm install -g openclaw        # if you have Node.js
# or
bun install -g openclaw        # if you have Bun
```

**Fix 3 — Skip local install, deploy to the cloud:**

Use the [one-click Render deploy](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/chrysb/alphaclaw) listed above. No local dependencies needed.

</details>

## Start here

**https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain** — clone this repo into your agent's filesystem. It's home base for docs, skills, upgrades, and recipes. To upgrade later: `git pull origin main && bun install`.

Copy this block into [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), [Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent), or any persistent AI agent. The agent reads the docs, does the work, and asks you for API keys. ~30 minutes.

```
INSTALL:

  git clone https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain.git ~/gbrain && cd ~/gbrain
  curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
  export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"
  bun install && bun link
  Verify: gbrain --version
  (If gbrain is not found, restart your shell or add the PATH export
  to your shell profile.)

API KEYS — ask the user for these:

  export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # required for vector search
  export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # optional, improves search quality
  Save to shell profile or .env. Without OpenAI, keyword search still
  works. Without Anthropic, search works but skips query expansion.

SET UP THE BRAIN:

  gbrain init                           # PGLite, no server needed
  Verify: gbrain doctor --json          # all checks pass

  The user's markdown files (notes, docs, brain repo) are SEPARATE from
  this tool repo. Ask the user where their files are, or create a new
  brain repo: mkdir -p ~/brain && cd ~/brain && git init

  Read ~/gbrain/docs/GBRAIN_RECOMMENDED_SCHEMA.md — set up the MECE
  directory structure (people/, companies/, concepts/, etc.) inside the
  user's brain repo, NOT inside ~/gbrain.

  gbrain import ~/brain/ --no-embed     # import markdown files
  gbrain embed --stale                  # generate vector embeddings
  gbrain query "key themes across these documents?"

GO LIVE — read and permanently adopt these docs from ~/gbrain/:

  docs/GBRAIN_SKILLPACK.md — the full agent playbook. Save to your
    memory: brain-first lookup on every message, entity detection,
    back-linking. This changes how you behave permanently.

  Set up recurring jobs using your platform's scheduler (crontab,
  OpenClaw cron, Railway cron, or a process manager):
    - Live sync (every 15 min): gbrain sync --repo ~/brain && gbrain embed --stale
    - Auto-update (daily): gbrain check-update --json (tell user, never auto-install)
    - Dream cycle (nightly): read docs/guides/cron-schedule.md for the
      full protocol — entity sweep, citation fixes, memory consolidation.
      This is what makes the brain compound. Do not skip it.
    - Weekly: gbrain doctor --json && gbrain embed --stale

  docs/GBRAIN_VERIFY.md — run all 6 verification checks. #4 (live sync
    actually works) is the most important.

INTEGRATIONS — run gbrain integrations list. Each recipe in
  ~/gbrain/recipes/ is a self-contained installer: it tells you what
  credentials to ask for, how to validate, and what cron to register.
  Ask the user which integrations they want (email, calendar, voice,
  Twitter). Set up the ones they have credentials for.
  Verify: gbrain integrations doctor (after at least one is configured)

UPGRADE: cd ~/gbrain && git pull origin main && bun install
```

### Without an agent (standalone CLI)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain.git && cd gbrain && bun install && bun link
gbrain init                     # local brain, ready in 2 seconds
gbrain import ~/notes/          # index your markdown
gbrain query "what themes show up across my notes?"
```

## Getting Data In

Once GBrain is installed, your agent needs data flowing in. GBrain ships integration recipes that your agent sets up for you. It reads the recipe, asks for API keys, validates each one, and runs a smoke test. [Markdown is code](docs/ethos/THIN_HARNESS_FAT_SKILLS.md)... the recipe IS the installer.

| Recipe | Requires | What It Does |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| [Public Tunnel](recipes/ngrok-tunnel.md) | — | Fixed URL for MCP + voice (ngrok Hobby $8/mo) |
| [Credential Gateway](recipes/credential-gateway.md) | — | Gmail + Calendar access (ClawVisor or Google OAuth) |
| [Voice-to-Brain](recipes/twilio-voice-brain.md) | ngrok-tunnel | Phone calls → brain pages (Twilio + OpenAI Realtime) |
| [Email-to-Brain](recipes/email-to-brain.md) | credential-gateway | Gmail → entity pages (deterministic collector) |
| [X-to-Brain](recipes/x-to-brain.md) | — | Twitter → brain pages (timeline + mentions + deletions) |
| [Calendar-to-Brain](recipes/calendar-to-brain.md) | credential-gateway | Google Calendar → searchable daily pages |
| [Meeting Sync](recipes/meeting-sync.md) | — | Circleback transcripts → brain pages with attendees |

Run `gbrain integrations` to see status. Dependencies resolve automatically. See [Getting Data In](docs/integrations/README.md) for the full guide.

## The Compounding Thesis

Most tools help you find things. GBrain makes you smarter over time.

```
Signal arrives (meeting, email, tweet, link)
  → Agent detects entities (people, companies, ideas)
  → READ: check the brain first (gbrain search, gbrain get)
  → Respond with full context
  → WRITE: update brain pages with new information
  → Sync: gbrain indexes changes for next query
```

Every cycle through this loop adds knowledge. The agent enriches a person page after a meeting. Next time that person comes up, the agent already has context. You never start from zero.

An agent without this loop answers from stale context. An agent with it gets smarter every conversation. The difference compounds daily.

> "Who should I invite to dinner who knows both Pedro and Diana?"
> — cross-references the social graph across 3,000+ people pages

> "What have I said about the relationship between shame and founder performance?"
> — searches YOUR thinking, not the internet

> "Prep me for my meeting with Jordan in 30 minutes"
> — pulls dossier, shared history, recent activity, open threads

## Voice: "Her" Out of the Box

The voice integration is the strongest demonstration of why a personal brain matters.
Call a phone number. Your AI answers. It knows who's calling, pulls their full context
from thousands of people pages, references your last meeting, and responds like someone
who actually knows your world. When the call ends, a structured brain page appears with
the transcript, entity detection, and cross-references.

This isn't a demo. It runs on a real phone number, screens unknown callers, and gets
smarter with every call. Your agent picks its own name and personality. WebRTC works in
a browser tab with zero setup. A real phone number is optional.

The voice recipe ships with GBrain: [Voice-to-Brain](recipes/twilio-voice-brain.md).
Your agent installs it, sets up the voice server, and you have a working AI phone line
in 30 minutes. 25 production patterns from a real deployment included.

## How this happened

I was setting up my [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) agent and started a markdown brain repo. One page per person, one page per company, compiled truth on top, append-only timeline on the bottom. The agent got smarter the more it knew, so I kept feeding it. Within a week I had 10,000+ markdown files, 3,000+ people with compiled dossiers, 13 years of calendar data, 280+ meeting transcripts, and 300+ captured original ideas.

The agent runs while I sleep. The dream cycle scans every conversation, enriches missing entities, fixes broken citations, and consolidates memory. I wake up and the brain is smarter than when I went to sleep. See the [cron schedule guide](docs/guides/cron-schedule.md) for setup.

**PGLite runs locally by default.** `gbrain init` gives you embedded Postgres with pgvector, hybrid search, and all 37 operations. No server, no subscription. When your brain outgrows local (1000+ files, multi-device access, remote MCP), `gbrain migrate --to supabase` moves everything to managed Postgres.

## Architecture

└──────────────────┘    └───────────────┘    └──────────────────┘
```

The repo is the system of record. GBrain is the retrieval layer. The agent reads and writes through both. Human always wins — you can edit any markdown file directly and `gbrain sync` picks up the changes.

## What a Production Agent Looks Like

The numbers above aren't theoretical. They come from a real deployment documented in [GBRAIN_SKILLPACK.md](docs/GBRAIN_SKILLPACK.md) — a reference architecture for how a production AI agent uses gbrain as its knowledge backbone.

**Read the skillpack.** It's the most important doc in this repo. It tells your agent HOW to use gbrain, not just what commands exist:

- **The brain-agent loop** — the read-write cycle that makes knowledge compound
- **Entity detection** — spawn on every message, capture people/companies/original ideas
- **Enrichment pipeline** — 7-step protocol with tiered API spend
- **Meeting ingestion** — transcript to brain pages with entity propagation
- **Source attribution** — every fact traceable to where it came from
- **Reference cron schedule** — 20+ recurring jobs that keep the brain alive

Without the skillpack, your agent has tools but no playbook. With it, the agent knows when to read, when to write, how to enrich, and how to keep the brain alive autonomously. It's a pattern book, not a tutorial. "Here's what works, here's why."

## How gbrain fits with OpenClaw/Hermes

GBrain is world knowledge — people, companies, deals, meetings, concepts, your original thinking. It's the long-term memory of what you know about the world.

[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) agent memory (`memory_search`) is operational state — preferences, decisions, session context, how the agent should behave.

They're complementary:

| Layer | What it stores | How to query |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **gbrain** | People, companies, meetings, ideas, media | `gbrain search`, `gbrain query`, `gbrain get` |
| **Agent memory** | Preferences, decisions, operational config | `memory_search` |
| **Session context** | Current conversation | (automatic) |

All three should be checked. GBrain for facts about the world. Memory for agent config. Session for immediate context. Install via `openclaw skills install gbrain`.

## The compounding effect

The real value isn't search. It's what happens after a few weeks of use.

You take a meeting with someone. The agent writes a brain page for them, links it to their company, tags it with the deal. Next week someone mentions that company in a different context. The agent already has the full picture: who you talked to, what you discussed, what threads are open. You didn't do anything. The brain already had it.

## Install

### Prerequisites

**Zero-config start (PGLite).** `gbrain init` creates a local embedded Postgres brain. No accounts, no server, no API keys. Keyword search works immediately. Add API keys later for vector search and LLM-powered features.

**For production scale (Supabase).** When your brain outgrows local, `gbrain migrate --to supabase` moves everything to managed Postgres:

| Dependency | What it's for | How to get it |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Supabase account** | Postgres + pgvector database | [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) (Pro tier, $25/mo for 8GB) |
| **OpenAI API key** | Embeddings (text-embedding-3-large) | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| **Anthropic API key** | Multi-query expansion + LLM chunking (Haiku) | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |

Set the API keys as environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

The Supabase connection URL is configured during `gbrain init --supabase`. The OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs read their keys from the environment automatically.

Without an OpenAI key, search still works (keyword only, no vector search). Without an Anthropic key, search still works (no multi-query expansion, no LLM chunking).

### GBrain without OpenClaw

GBrain works with any AI agent, any MCP client, or no agent at all. Three paths:

#### Standalone CLI

Install globally and use gbrain from the terminal:

```bash
bun add -g github:garrytan/gbrain
gbrain init                     # PGLite (local, no server needed)
gbrain import ~/git/brain/      # index your markdown
gbrain query "what themes show up across my notes?"
```

Run `gbrain --help` for the full list of commands.

#### MCP server (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)

GBrain exposes 30 MCP tools via stdio. Add this to your MCP client config:

**Claude Code** (`~/.claude/server.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gbrain": {
      "command": "gbrain",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor** (Settings > MCP Servers):
```json
{
  "gbrain": {
    "command": "gbrain",
    "args": ["serve"]
  }
}
```

This gives your agent `get_page`, `put_page`, `search`, `query`, `add_link`, `traverse_graph`, `sync_brain`, `file_upload`, and 22 more tools. All generated from the same operation definitions as the CLI.

#### Remote MCP Server (Claude Desktop, Cowork, Perplexity)

Access your brain from any device, any AI client. Run `gbrain serve` behind an HTTP
server with a public tunnel:

```bash
# Set up a public tunnel (see recipes/ngrok-tunnel.md)
ngrok http 8787 --url your-brain.ngrok.app

# Create a bearer token for your client
bun run src/commands/auth.ts create "claude-desktop"
```

Then add to your AI client:
- **Claude Code:** `claude mcp add gbrain -t http https://your-brain.ngrok.app/mcp -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"`
- **Claude Desktop:** Settings > Integrations > Add (NOT JSON config, [details](docs/mcp/CLAUDE_DESKTOP.md))
- **Perplexity:** Settings > Connectors > Add remote MCP ([details](docs/mcp/PERPLEXITY.md))

Per-client setup guides: [`docs/mcp/`](docs/mcp/DEPLOY.md)

ChatGPT support requires OAuth 2.1 (not yet implemented). Self-hosted alternatives (Tailscale Funnel, ngrok) documented in [`docs/mcp/ALTERNATIVES.md`](docs/mcp/ALTERNATIVES.md).

**The tools are not enough.** Your agent also needs the playbook: read [GBRAIN_SKILLPACK.md](docs/GBRAIN_SKILLPACK.md) and paste the relevant sections into your agent's system prompt or project instructions. The skillpack tells the agent WHEN and HOW to use each tool: read before responding, write after learning, detect entities on every message, back-link everything.

The skill markdown files in `skills/` are standalone instruction sets. Copy them into your agent's context:

| Skill file | What the agent learns |
|------------|----------------------|
| `skills/ingest/SKILL.md` | How to import meetings, docs, articles |
| `skills/query/SKILL.md` | 3-layer search with synthesis and citations |
| `skills/maintain/SKILL.md` | Periodic health: stale pages, orphans, dead links |
| `skills/enrich/SKILL.md` | Enrich pages from external APIs |
| `skills/briefing/SKILL.md` | Daily briefing with meeting prep |
| `skills/migrate/SKILL.md` | Migrate from Obsidian, Notion, Logseq, etc. |

#### As a TypeScript library

```bash
bun add github:garrytan/gbrain
```

```typescript
import { createEngine } from 'gbrain';

// PGLite (local, no server)
const engine = createEngine('pglite');
await engine.connect({ database_path: '~/.gbrain/brain.pglite' });
await engine.initSchema();

// Or Postgres (Supabase / self-hosted)
// const engine = createEngine('postgres');
// await engine.connect({ database_url: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
// await engine.initSchema();

// Search
const results = await engine.searchKeyword('startup growth');

// Read
const page = await engine.getPage('people/pedro-franceschi');

// Write
await engine.putPage('concepts/superlinear-returns', {
  type: 'concept',
  title: 'Superlinear Returns',
  compiled_truth: 'Paul Graham argues that returns in many fields are superlinear...',
  timeline: '- 2023-10-01: Published on paulgraham.com',
});
```

The `BrainEngine` interface is pluggable. `createEngine()` accepts `'pglite'` or `'postgres'`. See `docs/ENGINES.md` for details.

PGLite (default) requires no external database. For production scale (7K+ pages, multi-device, remote MCP), use Supabase Pro ($25/mo).

## Upgrade

```bash
cd ~/gbrain && git pull origin main && bun install
```

Then run `gbrain init` to apply any schema migrations (idempotent, safe to re-run).

## Setup details

`gbrain init` defaults to PGLite (embedded Postgres 17.5 via WASM). No accounts, no server. Config saved to `~/.gbrain/config.json`.

```bash
gbrain init                     # PGLite (default)
gbrain init --supabase          # guided wizard for Supabase
gbrain init --url <conn>        # any Postgres with pgvector
```

Import is idempotent. Re-running skips unchanged files (SHA-256 content hash). ~30s for text import of 7,000 files, ~10-15 min for embedding.

## File storage and migration

Brain repos accumulate binary files: images, PDFs, audio recordings, raw API responses. A repo with 3,000 markdown pages might have 2GB of binaries making `git clone` painful.

GBrain has a three-stage migration lifecycle that moves binaries to cloud storage while preserving every reference:

```
Local files in git repo
  │
  ▼  gbrain files mirror <dir>
Cloud copy exists, local files untouched
  │
  ▼  gbrain files redirect <dir>
Local files replaced with .redirect breadcrumbs (tiny YAML pointers)
  │
  ▼  gbrain files clean <dir>
Breadcrumbs removed, cloud is the only copy
```

Every stage is reversible until `clean`:

```bash
# Stage 1: Copy to cloud (git repo unchanged)
gbrain files mirror ~/git/brain/attachments/ --dry-run   # preview first
gbrain files mirror ~/git/brain/attachments/

# Stage 2: Replace local files with breadcrumbs
gbrain files redirect ~/git/brain/attachments/ --dry-run
gbrain files redirect ~/git/brain/attachments/
# Your git repo just dropped from 2GB to 50MB

# Undo: download everything back from cloud
gbrain files restore ~/git/brain/attachments/

# Stage 3: Remove breadcrumbs (irreversible, cloud is the only copy)
gbrain files clean ~/git/brain/attachments/ --yes
```

**Storage backends:** S3-compatible (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO), Supabase Storage, or local filesystem. Configured during `gbrain init`.

Additional file commands:

```bash
gbrain files list [slug]           # list files for a page (or all)
gbrain files upload <file> --page <slug>  # upload file linked to page
gbrain files sync <dir>            # bulk upload directory
gbrain files verify                # verify all uploads match local
gbrain files status                # show migration status of directories
gbrain files unmirror <dir>        # remove mirror marker (files stay in cloud)
```

The file resolver (`src/core/file-resolver.ts`) handles fallback automatically: if a local file is missing, it checks for a `.redirect` breadcrumb, then a `.supabase` marker, and resolves to the cloud URL. Code that references files by path keeps working after migration.

## The knowledge model

Every page in the brain follows the compiled truth + timeline pattern:

```markdown
---
type: concept
title: Do Things That Don't Scale
tags: [startups, growth, pg-essay]
---

Paul Graham's argument that startups should do unscalable things early on.
The most common: recruiting users manually, one at a time. Airbnb went
door to door in New York photographing apartments. Stripe manually
installed their payment integration for early users.

The key insight: the unscalable effort teaches you what users actually
want, which you can't learn any other way.

- 2024-11-15: Referenced in batch W25 kickoff talk
- 2025-02-20: Cited in discussion about AI agent onboarding strategies
```

Above the `---` separator: **compiled truth**. Your current best understanding. Gets rewritten when new evidence changes the picture. Below: **timeline**. Append-only evidence trail. Never edited, only added to.

The compiled truth is the answer. The timeline is the proof.

## How search works

```
Query: "when should you ignore conventional wisdom?"
         |
    Intent classifier (zero-latency, no LLM)
    → entity? temporal? event? general?
    → auto-selects detail level
         |
    Multi-query expansion (Claude Haiku)
    "contrarian thinking startups", "going against the crowd"
         |
    +----+----+
    |         |
  Vector    Keyword
  (HNSW     (tsvector +
  cosine)    ts_rank)
    |         |
    +----+----+
         |
    RRF Fusion: score = sum(1/(60 + rank))
    → normalize to 0-1
    → 2x compiled truth boost (entity queries)
         |
    Cosine re-scoring (0.7 * RRF + 0.3 * cosine)
    → query-specific chunk ranking
         |
    4-Layer Dedup + compiled truth guarantee
    1. Top 3 chunks per page
    2. Text similarity > 0.85
    3. Type diversity (60% cap)
    4. Per-page chunk cap (2)
    5. Guarantee compiled truth per page
         |
    Results
```

Keyword search alone misses conceptual matches. "Ignore conventional wisdom" won't find an essay titled "The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius" even though it's exactly about that. Vector search alone misses exact phrases when the embedding is diluted by surrounding text. RRF fusion gets both right. Multi-query expansion catches phrasings you didn't think of.

The query intent classifier reads your query and picks the right search mode. "Who is Alice?" surfaces compiled truth assessments. "When did we last meet Alice?" surfaces timeline entries with dates. No LLM call, just pattern matching. Use `--detail low/medium/high` to override.

Search quality is benchmarked: 29 fictional pages, 20 queries, graded relevance. Run `bun run test/benchmark-search-quality.ts` to reproduce. Measure changes with `gbrain eval --qrels queries.json`.

## Database schema

10 tables in Postgres + pgvector:

```
pages                    The core content table
  slug (UNIQUE)          e.g. "concepts/do-things-that-dont-scale"
  type                   person, company, deal, yc, civic, project, concept, source, media
  title, compiled_truth, timeline
  frontmatter (JSONB)    Arbitrary metadata
  search_vector          Trigger-based tsvector (title + compiled_truth + timeline + timeline_entries)
  content_hash           SHA-256 for import idempotency

content_chunks           Chunked content with embeddings
  page_id (FK)           Links to pages
  chunk_text             The chunk content
  chunk_source           'compiled_truth' or 'timeline'
  embedding (vector)     1536-dim from text-embedding-3-large
  HNSW index             Cosine similarity search

links                    Cross-references between pages
  from_page_id, to_page_id
  link_type              knows, invested_in, works_at, founded, references, etc.

tags                     page_id + tag (many-to-many)

timeline_entries         Structured timeline events
  page_id, date, source, summary, detail (markdown)

Indexes: B-tree on slug/type, GIN on frontmatter/search_vector, HNSW on embeddings, pg_trgm on title for fuzzy slug resolution.

## Chunking

Three strategies, dispatched by content type:

**Recursive** (timeline, bulk import): 5-level delimiter hierarchy (paragraphs, lines, sentences, clauses, words). 300-word chunks with 50-word sentence-aware overlap. Fast, predictable, lossless.

**Semantic** (compiled truth): Embeds each sentence, computes adjacent cosine similarities, applies Savitzky-Golay smoothing to find topic boundaries. Falls back to recursive on failure. Best quality for intelligence assessments.

**LLM-guided** (high-value content, on request): Pre-splits into 128-word candidates, asks Claude Haiku to identify topic shifts in sliding windows. 3 retries per window. Most expensive, best results.

## Library and MCP details

See [GBrain without OpenClaw](#gbrain-without-openclaw) above for library usage examples, MCP server config, and skill file loading.

The `BrainEngine` interface is pluggable. See `docs/ENGINES.md` for how to add backends. 30 MCP tools are generated from the contract-first `operations.ts`. Parity tests verify structural identity between CLI, MCP, and tools-json.

## Skills

Fat markdown files that tell AI agents HOW to use gbrain. No skill logic in the binary.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **ingest** | Ingest meetings, docs, articles. Updates compiled truth (rewrite, not append), appends timeline, creates cross-reference links across all mentioned entities. |
| **query** | 3-layer search (keyword + vector + structured) with synthesis and citations. Says "the brain doesn't have info on X" rather than hallucinating. |
| **maintain** | Periodic health: find contradictions, stale compiled truth, orphan pages, dead links, tag inconsistency, missing embeddings, overdue threads. |
| **enrich** | Enrich pages from external APIs. Raw data stored separately, distilled highlights go to compiled truth. |
| **briefing** | Daily briefing: today's meetings with participant context, active deals with deadlines, time-sensitive threads, recent changes. |
| **migrate** | Universal migration from Obsidian (wikilinks to gbrain links), Notion (stripped UUIDs), Logseq (block refs), plain markdown, CSV, JSON, Roam. |
| **setup** | Set up GBrain from scratch: auto-provision Supabase via CLI, AGENTS.md injection, import, sync. Target TTHW < 2 min. |

     gbrain migrate --to supabase/pglite
         (bidirectional migration)
```

Embedding, chunking, and search fusion are engine-agnostic. Only raw keyword search (`searchKeyword`) and raw vector search (`searchVector`) are engine-specific. RRF fusion, multi-query expansion, and 4-layer dedup run above the engine on `SearchResult[]` arrays. Both engines use the same SQL (PGLite runs real Postgres, not a separate dialect).

## Storage estimates

For a brain with ~7,500 pages:

| Component | Size |
|-----------|------|
| Page text (compiled_truth + timeline) | ~150MB |
| JSONB frontmatter + indexes | ~70MB |
| Content chunks (~22K, text) | ~80MB |
| Embeddings (22K x 1536 floats) | ~134MB |
| HNSW index overhead | ~270MB |
| Links, tags, timeline, versions | ~50MB |
| **Total** | **~750MB** |

Supabase free tier (500MB) won't fit a large brain. Supabase Pro ($25/mo, 8GB) is the starting point.

Initial embedding cost: ~$4-5 for 7,500 pages via OpenAI text-embedding-3-large.
